## What API Gateways do?

API gateways serve as intermediaries between clients (such as web or mobile applications) and backend services (such as databases, microservices, or legacy systems), providing a centralized entry point for accessing multiple APIs. Here are some key functions of API gateways:

1. **API Routing**: API gateways route incoming API requests to the appropriate backend services based on predefined rules, endpoints, or paths. This enables clients to access different functionalities or resources through a single entry point.

2. **Protocol Translation**: API gateways support various communication protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, WebSockets) and can translate between different protocols to ensure compatibility between clients and backend services.

3. **Request and Response Transformation**: API gateways can modify or transform incoming requests or outgoing responses to meet the requirements of clients or backend services. This includes data format conversion (e.g., JSON to XML), message enrichment, or content manipulation.

4. **Security and Authentication**: API gateways enforce security measures to protect APIs and backend services from unauthorized access, attacks, or misuse. This includes authentication (e.g., OAuth, API keys, JWT tokens), authorization (e.g., role-based access control), and encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS).

5. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: API gateways control the rate of incoming requests by enforcing rate limits, throttling, or quotas. This helps prevent abuse, protect backend services from overload, and ensure fair usage of resources.

6. **Caching**: API gateways can cache responses from backend services to improve performance and reduce latency for frequently accessed resources. Cached responses can be served to clients without forwarding requests to backend services, reducing the load on the infrastructure.

7. **Logging and Monitoring**: API gateways log information about incoming requests, outgoing responses, errors, and performance metrics. This data can be used for auditing, troubleshooting, monitoring API usage, and analyzing trends.

8. **Load Balancing and Scaling**: API gateways can distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend instances or servers to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. They can perform load balancing based on various algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections) and health checks.

9. **Analytics and Reporting**: API gateways provide analytics and reporting capabilities to track API usage, performance, and usage patterns. This includes metrics such as traffic volume, response times, error rates, and API usage patterns, which can be used for optimization and decision-making.

Overall, API gateways play a crucial role in managing the complexity of modern distributed systems by providing a unified interface for clients to interact with backend services securely, efficiently, and reliably.

## Schema Stitching

Schema stitching is a technique used in GraphQL to combine multiple GraphQL schemas into a single, unified schema. It allows you to create a cohesive API by aggregating types and fields from different GraphQL services or schemas. Here's an overview of how schema stitching works:

1. **Schema Definition**: Each GraphQL service defines its own GraphQL schema, which describes the types, fields, queries, mutations, and subscriptions that it supports. These schemas may represent different parts of your application or different microservices.

2. **Type Extensions**: In schema stitching, you can extend types and fields defined in one schema with types and fields from other schemas. This allows you to add additional functionality or merge related concepts from different services into a single cohesive schema.

3. **Type Merging**: When extending types across schemas, you need to ensure that there are no conflicts or inconsistencies between the types being merged. Schema stitching provides mechanisms for resolving conflicts and merging types with the same name or structure.

4. **Query Planning**: Before executing a GraphQL query, the schema stitching process performs query planning to determine how to resolve fields that span multiple schemas. This involves analyzing the query structure and identifying which parts of the query should be executed by each underlying service.

5. **Execution**: Once the query planning is complete, the stitched schema is used to execute the GraphQL query. The query is resolved by fetching data from the appropriate underlying services based on the field resolvers defined in the schema.

6. **Response Composition**: After executing the query, the results from the underlying services are composed into a single response object according to the structure defined by the stitched schema. This response is then returned to the client making the GraphQL request.

Schema stitching allows you to build a federated GraphQL API that spans multiple services or domains while presenting a unified interface to clients. It promotes modularity, reusability, and composability by enabling teams to develop and deploy GraphQL services independently and then stitch them together into a cohesive API. Additionally, schema stitching facilitates incremental adoption of GraphQL by allowing you to gradually migrate existing APIs or services to GraphQL without needing to rewrite everything at once.

## API Gateways vs Service Mesh

API gateways and service meshes are both essential components in modern microservices architectures, but they serve different purposes and address different concerns:

1. **API Gateways**:
   - **Purpose**: API gateways serve as a centralized entry point for clients (such as web or mobile applications) to access backend services (microservices, databases, legacy systems, etc.) through APIs.
   - **Functions**:
     - Routing and forwarding requests to the appropriate backend services based on predefined rules or paths.
     - Protocol translation, request/response transformation, and content negotiation.
     - Security enforcement, including authentication, authorization, and encryption.
     - Rate limiting, throttling, and caching to manage traffic and improve performance.
     - Logging, monitoring, and analytics for API usage and performance tracking.
   - **Scope**: API gateways typically operate at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model and are responsible for handling external traffic from clients.

2. **Service Mesh**:
   - **Purpose**: Service meshes are designed to manage communication between microservices within a distributed system, providing features such as service discovery, load balancing, resilience, and observability.
   - **Functions**:
     - Service discovery and routing to locate and communicate with other services within the mesh.
     - Load balancing to evenly distribute traffic across multiple instances of a service.
     - Circuit breaking, retries, and timeouts to improve resilience and fault tolerance.
     - Observability tools such as distributed tracing, metrics collection, and logging for monitoring and troubleshooting.
     - Security features like mutual TLS (mTLS) encryption, identity and access management, and service-to-service authentication.
   - **Scope**: Service meshes operate at the network layer (Layer 3/4) or the service-to-service communication layer of the OSI model and are focused on managing internal traffic within the infrastructure.

In summary, while API gateways and service meshes share some common functionalities such as routing and security enforcement, they serve different purposes and operate at different layers of the infrastructure stack. API gateways are primarily concerned with managing external traffic and providing an interface for clients to access backend services through APIs, while service meshes focus on managing communication between microservices within the distributed system. In many cases, organizations may use both API gateways and service meshes together to address different aspects of their application architecture.
